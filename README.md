# Soundboard
Collection of memes from our friendsgroup brought together in a soundboard.
I thought it would be fun to try to make this app crossplatform on a couple of often used platforms.

## The goal
The goal of the app is to have a fun, nice looking, functional sound board with the memes (that can be found in the audio directory).
The platforms I'd like to have the app working on:
* Windows 10 64-bit
* Ubuntu 16.* 64-bit
* Mac OS (insert whatever version, I don't know mac)
* Android (insert whatever version, I don't know android)
* IOS (I don't know what a reasonable version is, but it would be cool if it could run on my phone (IOS 7 orso))
* Web
